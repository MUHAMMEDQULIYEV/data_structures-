## How Solutions Are Organized

Each platform has its own directory, and within each directory:
- Solutions are organized by problem number or name
- Each solution includes the problem description or link
- Code is written in various programming languages (Python, Java, C++, etc.)

## Contributing

Feel free to add your own solutions! Please follow the existing structure:
1. Create a folder for the platform if it doesn't exist
2. Add your solution with a descriptive filename
3. Include comments with the problem link and description

## Languages Used

- Python
- Java
- C++
- JavaScript
- And more...
